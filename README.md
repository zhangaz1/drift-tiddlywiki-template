# Drift TiddlyWiki Template

Template version of https://github.com/akhater/akhater.github.io

_Note: I am not actively tracking @akhater's updates right now, but experimenting with using Github's "template" mode to make it even easier for people to get started with a GitHub Pages hosted TiddlyWiki_

## Instructions

* Click on the "Use this template" button
* Give your own repo a name and save (save it as a Private repo if you don't want others to see the content; you will also need to enable encrypted mode in TiddlyWiki)
* Under Settings, turn on Github Pages
* Visit the published page, which should look something like https://projects.bmannconsulting.com/drift-tiddlywiki-template/drift/ (so, if your repo is "mydriftrepo", it would be `yourgithubusername.github.io/mydriftrepo/drift/`)
* Turn on GitHub Save, and edits to your TiddlyWiki will save back to your repo, and then be published via Github Pages

_Note: your Github access token is stored in your local browser. In every machine / browser where you want to save (e.g. your mobile browser on your phone for example), you'll need to also copy in your access token, otherwise you won't be able to save edits there_

## To Do

* move the main empty Drift file to the root index
* document encryption
* investigate "single tiddler files" mode
