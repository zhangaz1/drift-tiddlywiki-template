# Drift TiddlyWiki Template

Template version of https://github.com/akhater/akhater.github.io

_Note: I am not actively tracking @akhater's updates right now, but experimenting with using Github's "template" mode to make it even easier for people to get started with a GitHub Pages hosted TiddlyWiki_

## Instructions

* Click on the "Use this template" button
* Give your own repo a name and save (save it as a Private repo if you don't want others to see the content; you will also need to enable encrypted mode in TiddlyWiki)
* Under Settings, turn on Github Pages
* Visit the published page, which should look something like https://projects.bmannconsulting.com/drift-tiddlywiki-template/drift/ (so, if your repo is "mydriftrepo", it would be `yourgithubusername.github.io/mydriftrepo/drift/`)
* Turn on GitHub Save, and edits to your TiddlyWiki will save back to your repo, and then be published via Github Pages

Read [Boris' post on the Fission blog for links to Git Save instructions](https://blog.fission.codes/tiddlywiki-as-the-original-serverless/)

## To Do

* move the main empty Drift file to the root index
* document encryption
* investigate "single tiddler files" mode
